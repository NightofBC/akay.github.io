<p>I am not a huge fan of social media&#8230; and making a website seemed like a good idea&#8230; so hello!</p>



<p>I am so excited to be able to share with you all what has been going on with my life these past few years! I have loved living in Rexburg and am grateful for all the people I have made a difference in my life. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So what is next?</h4>



<p>I will be attending Brigham Young University Idaho in the fall as a software engineering major. I will put my mission papers in during the summer, and will hopefully be leaving this next winter. After returning from my mission I will return to BYU-I to complete my schooling and enter the industry. Optimistically, I will get married and be able to start my family also during that time.</p>
